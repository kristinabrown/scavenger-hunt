Viewed from above, the 400,000 pieces of granite paving resemble a western diamondback rattlesnake. Find and photograph the tower with four “faces” along this mall. Tell me one reason why it is historically significant."},
                 {name: "El Chapultapec", clue: "This tiny jazz club opened in 1933, one day after Prohibition was repealed. Since then, the likes of Miles Davis, Stan Getz, and Chet Baker have played this club. Ella Fitzgerald was a friend of the club. Even President Clinton took the stage once. Photograph your teammates inside this club."},

Take a picture in the cookbook section."},
                 {name: "My Brother’s Bar", clue: "This place claims it is the oldest continuously operating bar in Denver, dating to 1871. Beatniks Jack Kerouac and Neal Cassady used to drink here, and a letter written by Mr. Cassady hangs on the wall. Tell us what the letter requests."},
                 {name: "Millennium Bridge", clue: "This steel marvel will take you back to the millennium. Climb the stairs and photograph your team near the 200 foot mast of this suspension footbridge, the first in the world to use post-tensioned structural construction."},

                 {name: "National Velvet Sculpture", clue: "Commissioned by the Denver Office of Cultural Affairs, National Velvet may not be as disturbing as Blue Velvet, but it has surely elicited some calls to the mayor's office. Photograph your teammates with this one of a kind sculpture."},
                 {name: "Turing School of Software and Design", clue: "Good work! The hunt is over, so head back to the dungeon for a sweet nacho bar."}
